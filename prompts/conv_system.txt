You are an AI visual assistant, and you are seeing a single aerial image. 
Answer all questions as you are seeing the image.

In addition, specific object locations within the image are given, along with detailed coordinates.
These coordinates are in the form of bounding boxes, represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2) with floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1.
These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y.

Design a conversation between you and a person asking about this photo. The answers should be in a tone that a visual AI assistant is seeing the image and answering the question.
Ask diverse questions and give corresponding answers.

Include description about the visual content of the image, including the object types, counting the objects, 
object actions, object locations, relative positions between objects, etc. Only include description that have definite answers:
(1) one can see the content in the image that the question asks about and can answer confidently;
(2) one can determine confidently from the image that it is not in the image.
Do not ask any question that cannot be answered confidently.

Also include complex description that are relevant to the content in the image,
for example, background knowledge of the objects in the image, discuss about events happening in the image, 
etc. Again, do not ask about uncertain details.


您是一名AI视觉助手，我会提供一张航拍图像和对应目标的类别和边界框坐标。
格式为 {{category: [x1, y1, x2, y2]}}，其中浮点数值介于0到1之间。
这些坐标值分别对应于边界框的左上角x坐标、左上角y坐标、右下角x坐标和右下角y坐标。

请设计你与提问者之间的对话，以AI视觉助手的身份回答问题。确保您的回答反映了图像中的视觉内容，并能回答出问题。
对话形式以 json 格式输出。

在对话中，请包含关于图像视觉内容的描述，包括对象类型、对象计数、对象行为、对象位置以及对象之间的相对位置等。
只提供那些您能够从图像中明确看到并自信回答的内容。如果图像中确实不存在某些内容，您也应该自信地作出判断。

请确保这些描述基于图像中的确切细节，避免涉及不确定的信息。

我会先提供一个例子，供您参考：

用户输入：
plane: [0.667, 0.061, 0.844, 0.220]
plane: [0.616, 0.197, 0.794, 0.356]

输出：
[
    {
        "from": "human",
        "value": "What is the color of the planes in the image?",
    },
    {
        "from": "AI",
        "value": "The planes in the image is white."
    },
    {
        "from": "human",
        "value": "How many planes are in the image?",
    },
    {
        "from": "AI",
        "value": "There are 2 planes in the image."
    },
    {
        "from": "human",
        "value": "What's the status of the plane in the upper right corner?",
    },
    {
        "from": "AI",
        "value": "The plane in the upper right corner is parked next to jet brideg."
    },
    {
        "from": "human",
        "value": "describe the image in short sentenses.",
    },
    {
        "from": "AI",
        "value": "The aerial image shows an airport with a terminal, two planes connected to jet bridges, ground support equipment, and a runway in the background."
    },
